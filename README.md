    Tensorflow Image Classifier with React Native
</h1>

Modified Template of [TensorFlow.js Example: React Native](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-examples/tree/master/react-native#tensorflowjs-example-react-native). This app takes a picture with the camera and classifies it with a pre-trained model.

## Made With
- React Native
- Expo
- Tensorflow.js
- React Navigation
- TypeScript

## Note
I had to update all dependencies to the latest versions using ```yarn upgrade --latest```  to resolve this issue: [Link](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs/issues/7056). So far seems to work with Expo SDK 49.
